### Getting Started 

* {link to web app}

* The user loads up the app and is  presented with two groups of dropdown menus representing options to fetch both a movie and recipe.

* The user then makes a selection for a movie based on genre and the app randomly selects a movie from the database and provides them with a the movie title, year of release, and link for them to watch the movie.

* To pair with the movie they are watching the user also selects a recipe at random based on the food category they selected  such as vegetarian, pasta, beef, etc. They are then provided with the recipe, list of ingredients, as well as steps to prepare the course. 

* The user can then provide their phone number if they please in order to have the recipe sent over to their phone to help with the gathering/shopping for ingredients.

* Additionally, the user has the option to register and save favorite recipes and movies as well as fill out their preferences regarding the two which will activate a "random night" feature which can summon a random movie and recipe based on the user's favorites.

### Known Issues

* Sometimes ingredients and instructions will be cut off on the edges when using smaller viewports.
